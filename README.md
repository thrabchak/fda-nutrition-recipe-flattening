Definitions:
- Food: composed of ingredients in specific proportions
- Ingredient: Either a food or a base ingredient
- Base ingredient: An ingredient that is not composed of another ingredient

- Some ingredients are foods themselves.
- We want a table showing the base ingredient proportions for each food.
